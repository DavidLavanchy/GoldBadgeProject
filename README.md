# EFA Gold Badge Console Application Challenges

##### The files listed in this repository were a part of the Gold Badge final with [Eleven Fifty Academy](https://www.elevenfifty.org/)

##### Each of these five applications utilize the CRUD methodology (create, Read, Update, and Delete) to store and manipulate data. Each application uses these methods in separate and unique ways to accomplish a task. Some of these applications utilize some of these methods and others utilize all of these methods, it just depended on the needs of the challenges. 

##### Each application is organized within three projects: __Console Application__, __Class Library__ and a __Unit Test Project__
